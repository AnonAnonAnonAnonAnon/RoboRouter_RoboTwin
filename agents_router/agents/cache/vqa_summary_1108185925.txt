The task aimed to grab the hammer and beat the red block. The robotic arm attempted the action but failed to make contact between the hammer and the block. According to the external signals, the task was unsuccessful as there was no contact between the actors, and the hammer's position relative to the block did not meet the required proximity. The entire process lasted 4 seconds and concluded without completing the intended beating action.
