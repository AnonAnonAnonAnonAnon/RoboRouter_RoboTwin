# RoboRouter – RoboTwin part

---

## TODO

- [ ] **(1) Run as many methods in RoboTwin as possible** (prioritize ones that are easier to run)
  - Obtain some **checkpoints** with a certain success rate (Find or train)
  - RoboTwin docs (9 methods, excluding **DexVLA** for now):  
    https://robotwin-platform.github.io/doc/usage/deploy-your-policy.html
  - **Other works with RoboTwin 2.0 implementations:**
    - H_RDT — https://github.com/HongzheBi/H_RDT
    - SimpleVLA-RL — https://github.com/PRIME-RL/SimpleVLA-RL
    - eVGGT — https://github.com/andvg3/eVGGT
  - **Related Work (kept updated):**  
    https://mcneznd3g628.feishu.cn/wiki/YZwTwwZZPi5Oiek18aocHVLQnTf

- [ ] **(2) Implement the minimal runnable method router** according to the system design (TBD)
  - The minimal agent call demo has now been implemented, including a retriever and a router, in agents/ma_router_retriever_min_gpt_demo.py
- [ ] others……
